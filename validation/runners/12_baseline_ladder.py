"""
12 Baseline ladder — how much of the gain is the model

Pre-registered criteria this runner answers: DR-26

Consumes
--------
* ``data/msme_loan_panel.csv``
      - account_id, month_idx, date, portfolio, constitution, secured,
        segment, sector, region, loan_type, qualification,
        promoter_age_group, log_sanctioned, business_age_years,
        vintage_months, dpd, utilisation, inflow, gst_sales, txn_count,
        bounce, minbal_breach, adverse_remark, dpd_max_6m, times_late_6m,
        bounces_6m, minbal_breach_6m, util_avg_3m, util_max_6m,
        months_over_90pct_util_6m, inflow_trend_3m, inflow_vs_6m_avg,
        sales_trend_3m, txn_drop_flag, adverse_remark_6m,
        default_within_12m, sma2_within_6m, labelable, months_to_npa
* ``data/rigor.json``
      - calibration.{reliability[], brier_raw, brier_cal},
        leakage.lead_time_attribution[], oot.{auc_early, auc_late},
        baseline_ladder[]

Produces
--------
* ``figures/baseline_ladder.png``
* one Result per criterion above: value, 95% CI, n (and `breakdown`
  with one dict per cell for the per-cut / per-portfolio / per-product ones)

Method, as pre-registered
-------------------------
Score three rungs on the same holdout with the same CIs: a DPD-only rule,
a logistic-regression scorecard (src/baseline_model.py), and the production
LightGBM. Report AUC per rung and the deltas between them.

Status
------
STUB. Raises NotImplementedError, which the harness records as `pending` for
every criterion above — never as a pass. The interface is written down now, ahead
of the first model result, while the data lanes are still changing the shape of
these files; implementing against a shape that is mid-flight would be worse than
documenting it.
