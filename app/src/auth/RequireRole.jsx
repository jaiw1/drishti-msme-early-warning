/**
 * Gate for "must be signed in AND hold one of these roles".
 *
 * `allow` takes either spelling from contracts/openapi.json — `['M','A']` straight out of
 * a route's `x-roles`, or `['manager','admin']`. An empty list means any signed-in user.
 *
 * A wrong role renders <PermissionDenied/> in place rather than redirecting: the user
 * asked for a real screen and deserves to be told why they cannot see it. The backend
 * refuses the data independently — this is UX, never the access control itself.
 *
 * The refusal is rendered **inside the app shell**, not as a bare panel on an empty page.
 * A role with no screen of its own in this product (a relationship manager, since
 * DRISHTi's screens narrowed to A/M/CO) would otherwise land on a panel with no header and
 * no way to sign out.
